            <h1>What the..?! Internet Explorer? Really?!</h1>
            <p>Did you know that you're using a browser that is <b>outdated</b>, <b>outclassed</b>, and downright <b>awful</b>? That is why you can't even see this website!! You are using some version of 
            Internet Explorer, and because of this, you are not seeing the web the way it was meant to be seen. Internet Explorer lacks many abilities that make the web a great and 
            safe place. So, do yourself a favor and upgrade to a modern browser today, and then you'll be able to come visit our site.<br /><br />Welcome to the internet, caveman.</p>
